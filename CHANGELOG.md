# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- MCP server migrated from the hand-rolled JSON-RPC/stdio implementation to
  the shared `SymairaMCP` module from `symaira-appkit` (exact-pinned 0.8.1):
  `TuneMCPServer` registers `tools/list`/`tools/call` on
  `MCPServer.withMethodHandler(_:)` over `MCPStdioTransport`. The tool list
  (names, descriptions, schemas incl. safety bounds) is unchanged; the wire
  framing is now newline-delimited JSON-RPC per the MCP spec (`#285`).
- `symaira-appkit` is now pinned `exact: "0.8.1"` instead of `branch: "main"`
  (`#286`).

### Added
- AI usage tracking for 10 providers: OpenRouter, Nous Portal, Moonshot, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Kimi Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Antigravity, Claude (`#268`–`#281`).
- CLI `symtune ai-usage` command and MCP `get_ai_usage` tool (`#270`).
- AI usage popover card, preferences toggles, keychain-backed credentials, and menu-bar readout (`#281`).
- Cache backoff and in-flight cleanup for AI usage service (`#282`).

### Fixed
- Charge limit re-assertion after wake with hysteresis band (`#267`).
- SMC pre-override state persistence so a killed process cannot strand hardware (`#263`).
- Lapsed charge limit reporting with exact applied percent (`#262`).
- CLI `version --check-for-updates` waits for its notice before exiting (`#265`).
- CodeQL Action updated to 4.37.5 (`#283`).

### Added
- SMC generation-aware temperature tables plus dynamic key enumeration (`#233`, `#240`).
- Battery Apple health numbers and live power draw reporting (`#234`, `#235`).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-08-06

### Added
- Menu-bar app migrated onto the shared Symaira design system (`SymairaTheme` from `symaira-appkit`): type-scale text roles (`symairaText`), color/spacing/radius tokens, and the shared text field style (`#226`).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-31

### Added
- Configurable popover cards: choose which cards are visible in the menu-bar popover (system status, metric history, displays, display controls, keep-awake, fan control) via the preferences view; the selection is persisted in `~/.config/symtune/config.toml` under `[popover] cards` (`#218`).

### Fixed
- SMC availability reporting now reflects the truth per host, and the status popover no longer overflows on hosts without fans or SMC write access (`#217`).
- Status panel no longer re-renders wholesale on every interaction; EDR overlay crash fix (`#209`).

### Tests
- Config-load test isolation, SMC param-block and transport tests, EDR overlay routing tests, app metric-formatting logic extracted to the core and covered (`#220`–`#223`).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-30

### Added
- Auto-update check on app launch, gated by a settings toggle in Preferences. When an update is found, the menu-bar app now offers an in-app "Jetzt installieren" install button (`UpdateApplier.applyBundle()`) with download progress and error handling, falling back to the manual download link when no release assets are available (`#202`, `#208`).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added
- System metrics service for CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization, exposed via CLI `symtune metrics` and MCP `get_system_metrics` (`#195`, `#196`, `#201`, `#203`).
- Preferences surface for metric selection, ordering, refresh interval and units (`#199`, `#204`).
- Live menu bar metric readout with monospaced digits, coexisting with the update badge (`#197`, `#205`).
- Rolling metric history with sparkline trends in the popover (`#200`, `#206`).

### Fixed
- Dim slider amount ↔ multiplier conversion fix (`#175`).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added
- Keep-awake sessions with timer-based expiry, duration presets, display-sleep toggle and remaining-time display. New CLI `symtune awake --for <duration>`, `--until HH:MM`, `status`, `off`. Extended MCP `keep_awake` tool and app Keep Awake card (`#178`).
- Update checking via `SymairaUpdateCheck` (from symaira-appkit): non-blocking GitHub release check with skip-version persistence. The menu-bar app (`SymTuneApp`) shows a subtle update card with Download/Skip buttons when a newer version is available; skipped versions are persisted via `UserDefaults` and never re-prompted (`#173`).
- `SymairaUpdateCheck` SPM dependency: `symaira-appkit` (commit 019e506). Provides the high-level `AppUpdateChecker` ObservableObject with `SkippedVersionStore` protocol and `UserDefaultsSkippedVersionStore`.
- `SymTuneApp` target in `Package.swift`: the menu-bar app can now be built directly with `swift build` and run with `swift run SymTuneApp`.
- CI workflow split: fast PR gate (lint + ubuntu tests) on PRs, full suite on main pushes + weekly schedule, CodeQL reduced to weekly schedule.

### Fixed
- Software Dimming slider conversion between view dim amount and core brightness multiplier scale (`#175`).
- Fan control `restoreAuto()` now correctly throws `noFansDetected` when no fans are present, matching `applyFan` behavior. Fan Control card in the app is gated on fan availability (`#176`, `#177`).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-07-24

(This version was prepared but not released — content folded into 0.4.0.)

### Fixed
- `restoreAuto()` throws `.noFansDetected` instead of silently succeeding on Macs without controllable fans (e.g. fanless MacBook Air), and the menu-bar app's Fan Control card is gated on fan availability (`#179`).
- CI: quote the SPM package revision in `project.yml` so it is not parsed as a YAML float.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added
- Fan control and battery charge limiting now ship in the open Apache-2.0
  core. New `fan set` / `fan auto` and `battery-limit set` /
  `battery-limit clear` CLI commands, plus matching `set_fan`,
  `set_charge_limit` and `clear_charge_limit` MCP tools. SMC writes require
  `sudo`, are clamped by `SafetyPolicy`, never disable firmware thermal
  protection, and restore the original SMC values on exit.
- `SMCWritePolicy` validation and SMC restore tracking for the new write
  paths, with unit tests across the controller, services and MCP tools
  (`#140`, `#141`, `#142`, `#143`).

### Fixed
- Correct `flt` byte order and map SMC write errors to `TuneError` instead of
  failing silently.
- Anchor the menu-bar status popover correctly below the menu-bar icon.
- Set the app delegate in the explicit main entry point of the menu-bar app.

### Changed
- `fan.control` and `battery.chargeLimit` are core-tier capabilities in
  `symtune doctor`. The previously planned privileged-helper requirement
  moved to an optional future convenience (see
  `docs/commercial-boundary.md`).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- Standalone `SymairaTune.app` release packaging alongside the `symtune` CLI,
  including reproducible XcodeGen builds and bundle smoke checks (`#129`).
- Homebrew cask generation that installs the menu-bar app and links the CLI
  binary (`#129`).

## [0.1.4] — 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Hardcoded tool version in `TuneVersion.current` is now synchronized with the release tag; release builds override it via `SYMTUNE_VERSION` so `symtune --version` matches the published release (`#112`).

### Added
- Release workflow verifies that the built binary reports the same version as the git tag before publishing the DMG (`#112`).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- TuneConfig.load validates bounds against SafetyPolicy after parsing (`#72`).
- DimOverlay.deinit delegates to `removeAllOverlays()` for main-thread safety (`#73`).
- Dim overlay update continues for all displays in multi-monitor setups (`#74`).
- MCP transport rejects oversized Content-Length payloads (8 MB limit) (`#80`).
- MCP header overflow now throws instead of returning partial data (`#81`).
- EDR overlay no longer force-unwraps a raw MTLPixelFormat value (`#82`).
- `symtune version --check-for-updates` is non-blocking and writes to stderr (`#83`).
- Profiles no longer persist an unused `awake` field (`#84`).
- Unexpected CLI errors include full context, not just localizedDescription (`#85`).
- Restore-on-exit returns EDR to its prior headroom (`#86`).

### Changed
- MCP tool schemas include numeric bounds (`minimum`/`maximum`) (`#75`).
- MCPServer split into MCPTransport, MCPTool, MCPArguments, MCPTools (`#78`).
- UpdateChecker cache uses a private actor instead of `nonisolated(unsafe)` statics (`#77`).
- MCP transport hardens header parsing with proper terminator handling (`#89`).
- DisplayService extended brightness comment corrected (`#87`).
- Dead `TuneProfile.awake` field removed from model (`#88`).

## [0.1.0] — initial release

### Added
- Built-in display brightness get/set (`#20`).
- `config.toml` configuration file with `SYMTUNE_*` environment variable
  overrides (`#19`).
- Extended/EDR brightness, software dim overlay, warmth, restore-on-exit,
  profiles, and SMC sensor reads (`#49`). Fan curves, charge limiting, and
  DDC/CI are Pro-tier features (privileged helper required).
- Documentation sync for v0.1 feature set (`#65`).

### Fixed
- OverrideTracker signal handler: use `_exit()` instead of `exit()` to avoid
  re-entrant cleanup (`#48`).
- Orphan `SymairaTune` target moved to `docs/planned/` (`#66`).

### Security
- Profile name path traversal and 13 additional findings (`#35`).
- Security and correctness bugs from code review (`#63`).
- Restricted `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions in CI workflows (`#67`).
