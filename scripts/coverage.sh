# Line/region coverage for the library targets, via SwiftPM + llvm-cov.
#
# Scope note (important when reading the numbers): the `symtune` executable is
# NOT part of this report. `SymTuneCLITests` exercises the CLI by spawning the
# built binary, so no coverage profile is collected for that process and
# `Sources/symtune/*` contributes to neither the numerator nor the denominator —
# its lines are absent, not counted as uncovered. Logic that should be measured
# therefore belongs in SymTuneCore/SymTuneMCP (see
# `Sources/SymTuneCore/ProcessListingPresentation.swift` for the pattern); the
# CLI target keeps argument plumbing and I/O only.
#
# Test sources are excluded too, so the percentage describes product code rather
# than being inflated by test files that are covered by construction.
#
# Usage: scripts/coverage.sh [--json <path>] [file-substring ...]
